    <p>Adding style and flair to any design scheme, bollards can add depth and dimension to a landscape. This high-quality bollard is made from a tough and durable Sapele wood and features a single LED for a neat and concentrated beam of light. Perfect for use with driveways and pathways, this bollard can be purposely positioned in a uniformed capacity to highlight a space or integrated into a landscape feature. For added flexibility, we have provided two cable entry options - side or base - depending on whether the bollard will be recessed or surface mounted, a choice between three white LED colour options, and three style options to finish these bespoke bollards.

        Made in Great Britain.</p>
